# Face-modelling-and-recognition
This bachelor project is based on presenting the main techniques used for the modelling and recognition of human faces, with special emphasis on the mathematical approach to this problem for the modelling and recognition based on the use of Differential Geometry. The starting idea is to perform appearance-based modelling and segment the face into regions with the same Gaussian curvature, in order to study its evolution when performing gestures by using flows (both curvature and variational).

Apart from this top-down approach, there is also an introduction to bottom-up strategies which are focused on a data-driven approach, capturing data and performing face recognition through holistic or local methods. Specifically, it is presented the eigenfaces method, as well as fisherfaces, giving a Python implementation in a Jupyter notebook of the first one.

In addition to the [project](./Project.pdf) and the [code implementation](./Eigenfaces.ipynb), it can also be found the [presentation](./Presentation.pdf) used during the defence of the project. There is also the original version of the project written in Spanish, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Malexba/tfg_matematicas).
